# AoC2022
Advent of Code 2022

My solutions for 2022 edition of advent of code.  
I do it mainly using short shell/awk scripts (soft codegolf) and c/c++ when shell/awk are not feasible.

task1 of day5 have two alternate solutions (C and awk)  
day13 is in C++ (task2 output requires postprocessing with shell)
